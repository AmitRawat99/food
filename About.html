            <p>
              Marketing restaurants has changed dramatically over the years.
              What worked 10 years ago, or even last year, doesn’t usually work
              anymore. It can be a struggle to find new customers for your
              restaurant with social media, new technology and more competition
              than ever before. Here is a quick list of ideas that we put
              together that every restaurant, big or small, should be doing to
              attract more customers to their restaurant. Sooner than later the
              majority of the content on the internet will be video. There is
              simply no better option for you to get people excited about dining
              at your restaurant than with an enticing video. It doesn’t need to
              be expensive, but make sure you have someone who knows what
              they’re doing to film and edit your story. A restaurant is a
              business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.
              Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many
              restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services.
              Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a
              wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from
              inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced
              family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.......

          <h2> SCHEDULE LIVE MUSIC</h2>
          <p>
            Everyone loves a little dinner entertainment. Scheduling live music consistently at your
             restaurant brings people in the door as it gives you events to promote and makes your 
             restaurant look like the place to be.
             Music is a form of art that uses sound organised in time.
              Music is also a form of entertainment that puts sounds together in a way that people like,
              find interesting or dance to. Most music includes people singing with their voices or playing 
               instruments, such as the piano, guitar, drums or bass.
               here is no simple definition of music which covers all cases. It is an art form, and opinions 
               come into play. Music is whatever people think is music. A different approach is to list the 
               qualities music must have, such as, sound which has rhythm, melody, pitch, timbre, etc.

          <h2> Home Delivery</h2>
          <p>
            Home delivery is the bringing of items to the customer's home rather than the 
            customer taking or collecting them from the store. In the first cash-and-carry stores,
             items were sold only for cash; no credit was extended, and no expensive home deliveries were provided.
             Home delivery refers to the final stage of the purchasing process between a seller and their customer. 
             When there are no timeline or qualitative disputes, delivery is the ultimate contractual step in the process 
             engaged between the seller and end customer. Home delivery is a contractual obligation defined arbitrarily at
              the time of purchase by the customer. Products are sent directly to the buyer’s address.Delivery options -
            including home delivery - serve as a major asset for retailers when faced with fierce competition. As such, 
            delivery lead times are a key factor. Home delivery and its various conditions are the best way to enhance 
            loyalty, and remain practically the only formal contact between the buyer and seller. Home delivery is therefore
